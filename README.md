# Bike Store Data Analysis

## Description

The Bike Store Data Analysis repository serves as a comprehensive project focused on the exploration and analysis of a Bike Store Relational Database. This initiative aims to derive meaningful insights from the provided dataset by employing various data analysis techniques.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/). I would like to express my gratitude to the original data provider for making this dataset available:

[Bike Store Relational Database | SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database)

## Project Goals

1. **Customer Segmentation per Location**: This project seeks to segment customers based on their geographical locations, allowing for a better understanding of the store's customer base and regional preferences.

2. **Sales and Quantity Table**: The repository aims to create and display a table that provides insights into sales data, quantities sold, and other relevant metrics. This table serves as a valuable resource for tracking sales performance.

3. **Store Performance Analysis**: To evaluate the performance of the three stores within the dataset, this project will conduct an exploratory analysis of their sales, customer traffic, and profitability.

4. **Sales Trend Analysis**: This repository will analyze sales trends over a span of three years. This information will help identify patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and growth opportunities.

5. **Order-to-Staff Ratio**: One of the key operational metrics, the order-to-staff ratio, will be computed and analyzed to assess the store's operational efficiency and staffing needs.

## Methodology

The dataset has been imported into MySQL Workbench, where preprocessing and analysis were performed. The code and queries used are included in this repository.
